---------------------------
Hey All, I'm Luigi nice to meet ya!
I work as Platform Engineer and here's a few things about me:


I'm passionate about IT and tecnology, love Kubernetes and write golang/python whenever I have the chance.

Discovered I love cycling so been doing that for a while now (you can find me on Strava, but I'm a very private person eheh).

When I am not working or exploring new tech/hobbies, I enjoy a good movie, videogames and spending time with my family ;)
