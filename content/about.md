---------------------------
Hello, my name is Luigi! Nice to meet you guys :)
I work as a Senior DevOps Engineer and here's a few things about me.

I love working in IT and I'm passionate about what I do. Currently, I love working with Kubernetes, write Terraform and program in Golang when I can! 

When I am not working (or studying), I enjoy a good movie, videogames and spending time with my family ;)
